                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> Hey everyone, my name is Dominic Fiorelli and I'm a 22 year old from Elk Grove Village, Illinois. I am the youngest of 3 siblings, I have an older brother (John 34), and a older sister (Angela 33).
                     A little bit about me is that I love skateboarding, thrifting and video games. In my free time I love spending time with my girlfriend and all of our friends, going down to Chicago and exploring all the hidden gems of the city. 
                     I think you'll find that I am a very outgoing and enthusiastic person. I love to make new friends and build connections with people I meet everywhere I go. 
                     I currently work at Woodfield mall at a store called Zumiez. I have worked there for 4 years now as an Assistant manager. 
                     I have built a lot of steady relationships with regular customers that I see at work. 
                     I went to community college for 2 years to study Graphic Design, and would like to go back to finish college and get a Graphic arts degree after I complete this course.  
                     I'm ready to learn fom you all and hone my skills as we progress throughout the course. Excited to get to know you guys and finish with success.

                <p> Skateboarding has been a huge part of my life growing up. I was first inspired by my older brother when I was about 8 years old. Funny enough I got my first skateboard from Zumiez.
                    I would skate with my bestfriend at the time around our neighborhood, but when winter came I was never able to skate and ended up stopping for several years.
                     I would pick it up from time to time, but I really got back into it my freshmen year of highschool. My sophmore year when I got my license I would be going to the skateparks near my house every single day.
                     My favorite thing about skateboarding is the community. You get to know everyone at your local parks and learn from them. Also seeing your progression over the years.
                     I have always wanted to make a full skate part of my own one day of all of my best tricks.

                <h1>Concerts</h1>
                <strong><small>More expensive favorite pastime</small></strong>
                <p> I am a huge fan of music, and it has always been a huge part of my life, just like skateboarding. Growing up my Dad would always play his favorite music from when he was younger,
                    and ive grown to appreciate his music taste as ive gotten older. I have been to more concerts and festivals than I can count on both of my hands. Not only is seeing your favorite artist live amazing,
                    but all of the memories you make at these concerts as well. I have traveled to New York and to Miami, Florida for Rolling Loud in 2019, and 2021. There are still a lot of artists I really want to see live.
                    If I could choose my top 1 Artist to see that I never have it would definitely be Kid Cudi.
